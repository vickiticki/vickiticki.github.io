    I moved to Japan in 2016 to teach English, but five years and one pandemic
    later I decide to return to the United States. Since returning, I’ve pivoted
    into a career in web development. I am primarily a frontend engineer with
    experience in the backend. Most recently I’ve been working in Typescript and
    Angular with occasional Ruby (and Rails), but in the past I’ve worked with
    React and C#. I’m a quick learner and have adapted to many environments,
    both here and abroad. I am passionate about learning new skills and sharing
    knowledge.
