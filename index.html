    <p>
      I moved to Japan in 2016 to teach English, but five years and one pandemic
      later I decide to return to the United States. Since returning, I’ve
      pivoted into a career in web development. I am primarily a frontend
      engineer with experience in the backend. Most recently I’ve been working
      in Typescript and Angular with occasional Ruby (and Rails), but in the
      past I’ve worked with React and C#. I’m a quick learner and have adapted
      to many environments, both here and abroad. I am passionate about learning
      new skills and sharing knowledge.
